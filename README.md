Phogo v3: The Return of the Turtle
-----

Modernizing the original projects.

Young me did not know how to use git, and the robot code is probably lost.
The website and dev server do install and start.

I have been able to install with:
- python 3.9.18 (3.10 breaks)
- node 10.24.1 (lts/erbium) (12 breaks)

To run the JS dev:
alias bower="./node_modules/bower/bin/bower"
alias gulp="./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js"
npm install
bower install
gulp dev


I will write the docs that I should have written as I re-discover this project.
In the branch `2017` is the original status of the various repos, as I have collected
them to revive this, with minimal changes, if any (to make them start).
